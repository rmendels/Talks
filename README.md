# Talks

- WestCoastWarming.pdf - Talk showing evidence that the so-called "blob" was due to a coast-wide warming starting late 2011,  combined with an artifact of the methods being used,  due to differential seasonal-shifts and local Ekman dynamics.
- TaoTalk.Rmd - `R` notebook showing that when properly analyzed, another "blob", this time in the tropics, was a product of not allowing for shifts in the seasonal.
- netCDF_Presentation - Presentation on accessing netCDF files in `R`.
- phase_talk - Talk on low-dimensional representations of dynamic systems with phase-lags,  examples in the Eastern Pacific including chlorophyll,  SST and surface currents.
