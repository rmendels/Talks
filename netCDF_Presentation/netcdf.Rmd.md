Why NetCDF Redux
========================================================
incremental: true
type: sub-section

- Most new satellite data (NOAA and NASA)  are in netCDF
- Most oceanographic, meteorological, and climate model output are in netCDF
- Self-Documenting 
- Can access metadata separately from the data
- Can directly access just a slice of the data without having to read through the entire file. 
- Chunking and compression (netCDF4)
